# LODLAM Workshop: Metadata Cleaning Portion Installation Instructions
## Required Preparation
This workshop will primarily work with **LODRefine** (Linked Open Data OpenRefine) or **OpenRefine** with the **DERI RDF Extension** installed. OpenRefine requires Java (see note in OpenRefine Installation instructions) and a web browser to run in (**Not Internet Explorer**).

#### OpenRefine Installation Choices:

1. [Already have OpenRefine or Google Refine Installed, just need to install DERI RDF Extension](AddDERIExtension.md)
2. [Already have LODRefine or OpenRefine with the DERI RDF Extension installed, just need to test it](OpenRefineInstallationTest.md)
3. [Don't have OpenRefine or LODRefine installed yet, or want to try a web-based version available thanks to RefinePro](OpenRefineInstallation.md)

#### Test Your OpenRefine Installation Choice
There is [1 installation test](OpenRefineInstallationTest.md) to make sure you are ready to go on workshop day.

## Optional Preparation

[The Optional Preparation document has information on some things you might consider setting up for this workshop, including](OptionalPrep.md):

#### RDF Editors

#### Python Reconciliation Service
Additionally, if you want to perform the local reconciliation parts of the workshop (and because we'll be working with conference wi-fi, if you want to do local reconciliation *this is recommended*), please install and/or setup on your computer **Python** (>=2.7) and **Pip** (or other Python package manager). 

#### Linked Data Fragments Server
We might work with **Linked Data Fragments** local servers in one of the clinic sessions, which will involve other installation requirements. This is entirely optional, obviously, but look this over at least if you're interested in learning more about working with that technology (along with **Heroku** if you'd like to push a LDF server to the web).

## Need Help?
If you have any issues with the following, please do not hesitate to contact Christina at cmharlow@gmail.com or @cm_harlow on Twitter. We can work issues out over email or set up a Google Hangout time for me to see the errors and try to help that way.
