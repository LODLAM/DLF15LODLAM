**Note to Participants**: Please have OpenRefine and the DERI RDF Extension or LODRefine installed before the start of the workshop. Instructions for installation are available at [Installation](Installation/README.md). If you run into any issues with installation, please get in touch with [me](mailto:cmharlow@gmail.com) as soon as you are able, and I'll work through these issues with you.

## Work Tracks 
Follow along with one of these tracks through the workshop. By the end, we won't have *perfect* or *complete* RDF files, but we'll know how to get there and have starter RDF objects.

- Import sample CSV data to make into a local SKOS/RDF "Authority" File
    - Cleaning terms
    - Building out related terms with URIs from other datasets
    - Producing SKOS RDF
    - Reconciling other datasets against our local Authority file
- Import sample DC/XML metadata to make into DC/RDF Objects
- Bring your own data & DIY it
